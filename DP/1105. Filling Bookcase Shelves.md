## Problem description
```
We have a sequence of books: the i-th book has thickness books[i][0] and height books[i][1].

We want to place these books in order onto bookcase shelves that have total width shelf_width.

We choose some of the books to place on this shelf (such that the sum of their thickness is <= shelf_width), then build another level of shelf of the bookcase so that the total height of the bookcase has increased by the maximum height of the books we just put down.  We repeat this process until there are no more books to place.

Note again that at each step of the above process, the order of the books we place is the same order as the given sequence of books.  For example, if we have an ordered list of 5 books, we might place the first and second book onto the first shelf, the third book on the second shelf, and the fourth and fifth book on the last shelf.

Return the minimum possible height that the total bookshelf can be after placing shelves in this manner.

 

Example 1:


Input: books = [[1,1],[2,3],[2,3],[1,1],[1,1],[1,1],[1,2]], shelf_width = 4
Output: 6
Explanation:
The sum of the heights of the 3 shelves are 1 + 3 + 2 = 6.
Notice that book number 2 does not have to be on the first shelf.
 

Constraints:

1 <= books.length <= 1000
1 <= books[i][0] <= shelf_width <= 1000
1 <= books[i][1] <= 1000
```

```java

    public int minHeightShelves(int[][] books, int shelf_width) {
        int n = books.length;
        //use dp array to store the min height of bookcase when i is the last book to be placed
        int[] dp = new int[n + 1];
        //0 books means 0 height
        dp[0] = 0;
        //iterate through all books
        for(int i = 1; i <= n; ++i){
            //initial state for dp
            dp[i] = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
            //try to use the last few books to create a optimal level
            for(int j = i - 1, width = 0, height = 0; j >= 0; --j){
                width += books[j][0];
                height = Math.max(height, books[j][1]);
                //too many books at this level
                if(width > shelf_width){
                    break;
                }
                //check if we minimized the height
                dp[i] = Math.min(dp[i], dp[j] + height);
            }
        }
        return dp[n];
    }
}

Time complexity: O(n^2)\
Space complexity: O(n)

## Notes
Use linear DP array to store the min height of bookcase when ith book is the last book. Then for each ith book, we can try to rearrange the last few books as 1 level as long as the total width doesn't go out of range. Then 1 of these arrangement must lead to the optimal height of the entire bookcase.\

dp[j] = min{dp[i - 1] + H}, 0 < i <= j. Where H is the height of the level arranged by the last few books.
