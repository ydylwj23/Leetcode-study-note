## Problem description
```
Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D and M.

Symbol       Value
I             1
V             5
X             10
L             50
C             100
D             500
M             1000
For example, two is written as II in Roman numeral, just two one's added together. Twelve is written as, XII, which is simply X + II. The number twenty seven is written as XXVII, which is XX + V + II.

Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not IIII. Instead, the number four is written as IV. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as IX. There are six instances where subtraction is used:

I can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9. 
X can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90. 
C can be placed before D (500) and M (1000) to make 400 and 900.
Given an integer, convert it to a roman numeral. Input is guaranteed to be within the range from 1 to 3999.

Example 1:

Input: 3
Output: "III"
Example 2:

Input: 4
Output: "IV"
Example 3:

Input: 9
Output: "IX"
Example 4:

Input: 58
Output: "LVIII"
Explanation: L = 50, V = 5, III = 3.
Example 5:

Input: 1994
Output: "MCMXCIV"
Explanation: M = 1000, CM = 900, XC = 90 and IV = 4.

## 5/21/2019 Naive digit by digit

```java
class Solution {
    public String intToRoman(int num) {
        //use map to store symbols for each value
        Map<Integer, Character> dict = new HashMap<>();
        dict.put(1, 'I');
        dict.put(5, 'V');
        dict.put(10, 'X');
        dict.put(50, 'L');
        dict.put(100, 'C');
        dict.put(500, 'D');
        dict.put(1000, 'M');
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        int zeros = 0;
        //extract each digit
        while (num != 0){
            int digit = num % 10;
            int dFull = digit * (int)Math.pow(10, zeros);
            //process the digit
            if (digit == 9){
                sb.insert(0, dict.get(dFull / digit * 10));
                sb.insert(0, dict.get(dFull / digit));
            }
            else if (digit >= 5){
                for (int i = digit - 5; i > 0; --i){
                    sb.insert(0, dict.get(dFull / digit));
                }
                sb.insert(0, dict.get(dFull / digit * 5));
            }
            else if (digit == 4){
                sb.insert(0, dict.get(dFull / digit * 5));
                sb.insert(0, dict.get(dFull / digit));
            }
            else{
                for (int i = digit; i > 0; --i){
                    sb.insert(0, dict.get(dFull / digit));
                }
            }
            num /= 10;
            ++zeros;
        }
        return sb.toString();
    }
}
```

## Notes
from right to left, we extract every digit and comput it's corresponding string.

## 5/21/2019 Greedy left to right

```java
class Solution {
    int[] values = {1000, 900, 500, 400, 100, 90, 50, 40, 10, 9, 5, 4, 1};    
    String[] symbols = {"M","CM","D","CD","C","XC","L","XL","X","IX","V","IV","I"};

    public String intToRoman(int num) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        // Loop through each symbol, stopping if num becomes 0.
        for (int i = 0; i < values.length && num >= 0; i++) {
            // Repeat while the current symbol still fits into num.
            while (values[i] <= num) {
                num -= values[i];
                sb.append(symbols[i]);
            }
        }
        return sb.toString();
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analyze
hash map + greedy\
Time complexity: O(1)\
Space complexity: O(1)

## Notes
We greedily try to deduct the largest possible preexist number out of the original number as many times as we could until the original number is 0. Every deduction gives us a string to append to the answer string.
