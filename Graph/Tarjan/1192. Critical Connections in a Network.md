## LeetCode link(Hard)
hhttps://leetcode.com/problems/critical-connections-in-a-network/

## Keyword
Graph, Tarjan, bridge

## Problem description
```
There are n servers numbered from 0 to n-1 connected by undirected server-to-server connections forming a network where connections[i] = [a, b] represents a connection between servers a and b. Any server can reach any other server directly or indirectly through the network.

A critical connection is a connection that, if removed, will make some server unable to reach some other server.

Return all critical connections in the network in any order.

 

Example 1:



Input: n = 4, connections = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,0],[1,3]]
Output: [[1,3]]
Explanation: [[3,1]] is also accepted.
 

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 10^5
n-1 <= connections.length <= 10^5
connections[i][0] != connections[i][1]
There are no repeated connections.

Time complexity: O(E + V)\
Space complexity: O(E + V)

## Notes
We can use Tarjan Algorithm to find all the bridges in a graph. The idea of Tarjan Algorithm is to determine if a target component has any backloop edges to connect to the originating component other than the edge used to detect the target edge. Note that this algorithm can also be used to detect Articulation Points.
